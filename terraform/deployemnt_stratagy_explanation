Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions/Jenkins + SSM Parameter Store
üéØ The Complete Deployment Workflow
High-Level Architecture
Your deployment automation follows an immutable infrastructure pattern where every release creates a new AMI, updates SSM parameters, and triggers rolling deployments. This approach ensures consistency, reliability, and easy rollbacks.
The Deployment Pipeline Flow
1. Code Commit Trigger

Developer pushes code to repository (main/release branch)
GitHub Actions or Jenkins detects the change via webhooks
Pipeline automatically starts based on predefined triggers

2. Build Phase

CI/CD downloads the latest code
Runs tests (unit, integration, security scans)
If tests pass, proceeds to image building phase

3. AMI Creation with Packer

Packer builds a new AMI with the latest application code
Application is pre-installed, configured, and optimized
AMI includes all dependencies, runtime configurations
Critical: Packer automatically updates SSM Parameter Store with new AMI ID

4. Infrastructure Update

CI/CD triggers Terraform with the updated SSM parameters
Terraform detects the SSM parameter change
Creates new Launch Template version automatically
No manual intervention required

5. Rolling Deployment

Auto Scaling Group detects new Launch Template version
Starts instance refresh process automatically
Gradually replaces old instances with new ones
Maintains service availability during deployment

6. Validation & Monitoring

Health checks ensure new instances are healthy
Application-level checks verify functionality
Rollback triggers if validation fails

üîÑ SSM Parameter Store Integration Benefits
Single Source of Truth
SSM Parameter Store acts as the central registry for AMI versions. When Packer builds a new AMI, it immediately updates the parameter, making the new version available to Terraform without any manual steps.
Automatic Infrastructure Updates
Terraform continuously monitors SSM parameters. When values change, Terraform automatically plans and applies infrastructure updates. This creates a GitOps-style workflow where infrastructure state follows application state.
Deployment Coordination
Multiple environments (dev, staging, production) can have separate SSM parameters. CI/CD pipelines can promote AMIs through environments by updating the appropriate SSM parameters for each environment.
üöÄ GitHub Actions Integration Strategy
Multi-Stage Pipeline Approach
GitHub Actions excels at matrix builds and parallel execution. You can build frontend and backend AMIs simultaneously, each updating their respective SSM parameters. The workflow then waits for both to complete before triggering Terraform.
Environment Promotion
GitHub Actions can implement environment-specific deployments using different SSM parameter paths. Development deployments happen automatically on feature branch merges, while production requires manual approval gates.
Secrets Management
GitHub Secrets integrate seamlessly with AWS credentials needed for Packer, SSM, and Terraform operations. The OIDC provider approach eliminates long-lived credentials.
üîß Jenkins Integration Strategy
Pipeline as Code
Jenkins pipelines defined in Jenkinsfiles provide complex orchestration capabilities. You can implement sophisticated deployment logic, including blue-green deployments, canary releases, and automated rollback decisions.
Plugin Ecosystem
Jenkins offers extensive AWS plugins for seamless integration with SSM Parameter Store, Auto Scaling Groups, and CloudWatch monitoring. These plugins provide built-in error handling and retry mechanisms.
Multi-Branch Deployments
Jenkins can automatically create deployment pipelines for feature branches, enabling preview environments with isolated infrastructure stacks while sharing the same SSM-based deployment pattern.
üìä Deployment Automation Advantages
Immutable Infrastructure Benefits
Every deployment creates a completely new infrastructure state. This eliminates configuration drift, ensures reproducible deployments, and makes troubleshooting easier since each version is completely isolated.
Zero-Downtime Deployments
Auto Scaling Groups perform rolling updates automatically. New instances are brought online and health-checked before old instances are terminated. This happens without any service interruption.
Instant Rollbacks
Since previous AMI IDs are stored in SSM parameters, rollbacks are immediate. CI/CD can simply update the SSM parameter to the previous value, triggering an automatic rollback deployment.
Audit Trail
SSM Parameter Store maintains a complete history of all AMI deployments. Combined with CI/CD logs, you have full traceability of who deployed what, when, and why.
üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices for CI/CD Integration
Staged Deployments
Implement environment progression where changes flow through development ‚Üí staging ‚Üí production. Each stage validates the deployment before promoting to the next environment.
Automated Testing Integration
CI/CD pipelines should include smoke tests and integration tests that run against newly deployed instances. Failed tests should trigger automatic rollbacks.
Monitoring Integration
Connect CI/CD with monitoring systems to track deployment metrics. CloudWatch, DataDog, or Prometheus can provide deployment success/failure signals back to the pipeline.
Approval Gates
For production deployments, implement human approval workflows. GitHub Actions and Jenkins both support manual approval steps before critical deployments proceed.
Parallel Deployments
Frontend and backend can be deployed independently since they use separate SSM parameters and Auto Scaling Groups. This enables faster release cycles and independent team velocities.
‚ö° Performance and Efficiency
Fast Feedback Loops
The SSM + Terraform integration provides immediate feedback when deployments fail. CI/CD pipelines can detect infrastructure update failures quickly and initiate corrective actions.
Resource Optimization
Auto Scaling Groups ensure right-sizing during deployments. Instances are replaced with the exact same configuration, maintaining performance characteristics while updating application code.
Cost Management
Immutable deployments prevent infrastructure snowflakes that accumulate unnecessary resources over time. Each deployment starts with a clean, optimized baseline.
üéØ Deployment Strategy Patterns
Blue-Green Deployments
CI/CD can orchestrate blue-green deployments by creating entirely new Auto Scaling Groups with updated SSM parameters, then switching traffic via load balancers.
Canary Releases
Start with a small percentage of instances using the new AMI. CI/CD monitors metrics and gradually increases the percentage if deployment metrics remain healthy.
Feature Flags Integration
Combine AMI deployments with feature flags to deploy code without immediately activating features. This separates deployment risk from feature risk.
This architecture provides a fully automated, reliable, and scalable deployment system that integrates seamlessly with modern CI/CD practices while maintaining the flexibility to support various deployment strategies and organizational workflows
